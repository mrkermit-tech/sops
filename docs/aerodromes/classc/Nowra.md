## Airspace
NW ADC owns the Class C airspace from `SFC` to `A020`, 5nm from the NWA TACAN. This airspace is designed to facilitate Helicopter Traffic and Ciruit Traffic.

## Aerodrome

### General Guidelines

1. **Ground Taxiing for Wheeled Helicopters**
    - Where practicable, wheeled helicopters are encouraged to “ground taxi” on prepared surfaces to minimize rotor wash and its effects.

### Runway Modes

a) Runway 21 and Runway 08;  
b) Runway 21 and Runway 26;  
c) Runway 03 and Runway 08;  
d) Runway 03 and Runway 26;   

## Charts
!!! note
    Additional charts to the AIP may be found in the RAAF TERMA document, available towards the bottom of [RAAF AIP page](https://ais-af.airforce.gov.au/australian-aip){target=new}

## Miscellaneous
### Circuit Procedures

Circuit operations at Nowra occur within the circuit area (CIRA), a `5NM` radius of NWA TACAN, from the `SFC` to `A020`.

- Fixed wing: `A020`
- Rotary wing: `A012`
- Flight Deck Procedural Trainer: not above `A007`

### Circuit Direction
| Runway | Direction |
| ------ | ----------|
| 08     | Right  |
| 21     | Right |
| 03     | Left |
| 26     | Left |

## Helicopter Operations

### Helicopter Spots

The following helicopter spots are designated on various taxiways at Nowra aerodrome to facilitate visual helicopter arrivals and departures day and night.

IFR traffic must depart from the active duty runway.

These spots are physically marked with bidirectional numbers in addition to the standard “H” marking:

* Spot-1 (Taxiway C2)
* Spot-2 (Taxiway C3)
* Spot-3 (Taxiway B4)
* Spot-4 (Taxiway B4)
* Spot-5 (Taxiway B3)
* Spot-6 (Taxiway B3)
* Spot-7 (Taxiway A2)
* Spot-8 (Taxiway A2)

Helicopter departures for aircraft not requiring the use of a runway shall be conducted from the helicopter spots.  Helicopter spots shall be used by all departures and arrivals. Helicopters must remain at their designated slot until given a clearance from GND or TWR.

Take-offs and landings to the Helicopter Spots should be parallel to the duty RWY direction. Normally the most upwind Helicopter Spot parallel to the RWY is designated for departures, and the downwind Helicopter Spot designated for arrivals. Helicopter Spots have been designed to allow simultaneous arrivals and departures of an adjacent Helicopter Spot.

Post landing at a Helicopter Spot, helicopters shall not vacate the Spot until in receipt of a taxi clearance from ATC (SMC)

### Duty runway Spots
| Active Runway | Departure Spots (Order of Preference) | Arrival Spots (Order of Preference) |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Runway 08     | Spot-2 (C3), Spot-1 (C2)               | Spot-8 (A2), Spot-7 (A2)            |
| Runway 26     | Spot-8 (A2), Spot-7 (A2)               | Spot-2 (C3), Spot-1 (C2)            |
| Runway 03     | Spot-6 (B3), Spot-5 (B3)               | Spot-4 (B4), Spot-3 (B4)            |
| Runway 21     | Spot-4 (B4), Spot-3 (B4)               | Spot-6 (B3), Spot-5 (B3)            |


## Coordination
NW TCU

'Next' coordination is required from NW ADC to NW TCU for all aircraft.

Helicopter departing from helicopter spots will be treated as if departing from that duty runway.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**NW ADC** -> **NW TCU**</span>: "Next, ASY01, runway 08"  
    <span class="hotline">**NW TCU** -> **NW ADC**</span>: "ASY01, Assigned Heading Left 030, unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**NW ADC** -> **NW TCU**</span>: "Assigned Heading Heading Left 030, ASY01" 


### Level Assignment
The Standard Assignable Level from **NW ADC** to **NW TCU** is:

Issue `F120` or `RFL`; whichever is lower.
