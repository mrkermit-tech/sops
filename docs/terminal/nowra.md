## Airspace

### TMA Ownership

The Terminal Control Area (TMA) owns the airspace within R421 up to `F125`; optionally R420F extends from `F125` to `F300`.
This airspace is for facilitating military aircraft and low-level helicopter operations.

### Activation of Restricted Areas

When a controller logs in as Nowra TMA for R421:

1. **Announce Activation**: Announce that R421 and other applicable PRDs are active.
2. **Activate Surrounding Areas**: Notify surround controllers to activate the restricted areas to get the outlines visible.
3. **Issue Clearances**: Treat restricted areas like R421 as Class C airspace and issue clearances accordingly.
4. **Service Level**: Class C while R421 is active.

To activate R420:
1. Get an airspace release from BIK. Voiceless coord of all aircraft on published air routes via the NWA TACAN above `F125`.
